# HTML Form + JavaScript Validation

This project consists of HTML files with JavaScript solutions for various form validation tasks. Each task has its own HTML file, JavaScript file, and specific requirements.

## General Requirements

- Recommended editors: Visual Studio Code.
- All files should end with a new line.
- You are not allowed to install, import, or use external libraries. The website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with the W3C Validator.

## Task 0: Form Validation - Password Strength

- **HTML File:** `password.html`
- **JavaScript File:** `0-password-strength.js`

This task focuses on validating password strength based on specific criteria. The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one numeric digit, and one special character.

## Task 1: Form Validation - Email Validation

- **HTML File:** `email.html`
- **JavaScript File:** `1-email-validation.js`

In this task, email format validation is implemented. The email must follow the standard email format with an alphanumeric username, followed by the "@" symbol, and then the domain name.

## Task 2: Dynamic Form Field

- **HTML File:** `dynamic-form.html`
